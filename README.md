## Hi there 👋, I'm Yangfan(or Krystal)

I'm a passionate data analyst and statistician, recently graduated from Iowa State University with a dual major in **Data Science** and **Statistics**. My primary focus is on statistical analysis, machine learning, and practical data applications using **Python** and **R**.

I believe in the power of clean data, rigorous inference, and interpretable models. I'm currently based in Shenzhen, China, actively exploring job opportunities in data-driven roles and building a strong foundation for future graduate studies in statistics.

## 🔧 Skills & Tools

**Programming & Data Science**  
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels)  
- R (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, caret, glm, survival analysis)  
- SQL (basic to intermediate querying, joins, subqueries)  

**Statistics & Modeling**  
- Linear & logistic regression, ANOVA, non-parametric tests  
- Time series analysis, survival analysis, experimental design  
- Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, bootstrapping  
- Statistical inference, model diagnostics, AIC/BIC selection  

**Machine Learning**  
- Supervised learning: decision trees, k-NN, support vector machines  
- Unsupervised learning: clustering (k-means, hierarchical), PCA  
- Model evaluation: cross-validation, ROC/AUC, overfitting mitigation  
- Some exposure to deep learning (PyTorch basics, CNNs for classification)

## 🧭 Future Plan

I plan to maintain a small but focused set of public projects and statistical analyses, mostly built with Python and R. These projects will focus on:

- Classic statistical methods applied to real-world datasets  
- Case studies useful for applied statistics graduate programs  
- Demonstrations of clear documentation, reproducibility, and interpretability  
- Minimal focus on hype-based black-box modeling — instead, clarity and honesty in modeling and reporting
