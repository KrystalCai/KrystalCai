## Hi there 👋, I'm Yangfan (Krystal)

I'm a data analyst and statistician, recently graduated from **Iowa State University** with dual bachelor's degrees in **Data Science** and **Statistics**.  
My focus lies in **statistical analysis, machine learning, and real-world data applications** using **Python** and **R**.  

Currently based in **Shenzhen, China**, I'm actively developing data-driven projects and exploring professional opportunities in analytics and applied statistics.

## 🧭 Future Plan
I plan to maintain a focused set of public projects and statistical analyses, mostly built with Python and R. These projects will highlight:  

- Classic statistical methods applied to real-world datasets  
- Case studies that demonstrate practical business and research insights  
- Clear documentation, reproducibility, and interpretability  
- Emphasis on transparency in modeling, rather than black-box approaches
