## Hi there 👋, I'm Yangfan(or Krystal)

I'm a passionate data analyst and statistician, recently graduated from Iowa State University with a dual major in **Data Science** and **Statistics**. My primary focus is on statistical analysis, machine learning, and practical data applications using **Python** and **R**.

I believe in the power of clean data, rigorous inference, and interpretable models. I'm currently based in Shenzhen, China, actively exploring job opportunities in data-driven roles and building a strong foundation for future graduate studies in statistics.

## 🧭 Future Plan

I plan to maintain a small but focused set of public projects and statistical analyses, mostly built with Python and R. These projects will focus on:

- Classic statistical methods applied to real-world datasets  
- Case studies useful for applied statistics graduate programs  
- Demonstrations of clear documentation, reproducibility, and interpretability  
- Minimal focus on hype-based black-box modeling — instead, clarity and honesty in modeling and reporting
